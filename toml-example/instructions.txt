this will show you how you can start implementing toml
files into your project


-----------------getting python ready-----------------

this example uses tomli, the old version of tomllib so
just replace everything that says tomli with tomllib


what you will do is you import the tomllib library

> you do have to install it first with pip install

`import tomllib`

then copy and paste this piece of code into the 
begining of your python file 

`with open("[toml_name_here]", "rb") as f:
    data = tomllib.load(f)`

replace [toml_name_here] with the name of your toml 
file


----getting variables and values out of toml file----


here we are going to asign the information into 
variables

say you want to get the whole toml file printed out,

we already asigned the toml file into a variable so 
the only thing we have to do is print it out

`print(data)`

but what if you only want one section?
well when toml parses the data, it works like a 
dictionary

`section = data["section"]`

so you replace section with the section name

but what about only one variable in one section?

same thing

`print(data["section"]["variable"])`

just add another brace

Steganography tool fixed (server errors)

The past few weeks you may have seen a server error or two on the steganography tool. These intermittent errors were a byproduct of the recent server move and have now been fixed.

Phasing out hosting server after (almost) 10 years

After having been running steadily on the previous server for almost ten(!) years, it became time to retire that machine. So, ManyTools has now been moved to a shiny new hosting cluster. You may/should notice some speed improvements. In case you notice any problems or irregularities I'd be happy if you notify me so I can check on them.

Exit Coinhive (in-browser bitcoin mining)

Thank you for your feedback on our (brief) test with browser based bitcoin mining. This seemed like a nice way to support this website, but turned out to be far too much of a burden to our visitors. So we've decided to remove it. Our apologies for the inconvenience it has caused.

Migrated to HTTPS

Happy to inform that Manytools is now fully Chrome-62-ready, thanks Google! A secure connection had been due for a very long time. Today we finally got around to upgrading the site to run on HTTPS. – (Starting October 2017, Chrome (version 62) will show a “NOT SECURE” warning when users enter text in a form on an HTTP page, and for all HTTP pages in Incognito mode.)

Steganography tool fixed (server errors)

The past few weeks you may have seen a server error or two on the steganography tool. These intermittent errors were a byproduct of the recent server move and have now been fixed.

Phasing out hosting server after (almost) 10 years

After having been running steadily on the previous server for almost ten(!) years, it became time to retire that machine. So, ManyTools has now been moved to a shiny new hosting cluster. You may/should notice some speed improvements. In case you notice any problems or irregularities I'd be happy if you notify me so I can check on them.

Exit Coinhive (in-browser bitcoin mining)

Thank you for your feedback on our (brief) test with browser based bitcoin mining. This seemed like a nice way to support this website, but turned out to be far too much of a burden to our visitors. So we've decided to remove it. Our apologies for the inconvenience it has caused.

Migrated to HTTPS

Happy to inform that Manytools is now fully Chrome-62-ready, thanks Google! A secure connection had been due for a very long time. Today we finally got around to upgrading the site to run on HTTPS. – (Starting October 2017, Chrome (version 62) will show a “NOT SECURE” warning when users enter text in a form on an HTTP page, and for all HTTP pages in Incognito mode.)

Steganography tool fixed (server errors)

The past few weeks you may have seen a server error or two on the steganography tool. These intermittent errors were a byproduct of the recent server move and have now been fixed.

Phasing out hosting server after (almost) 10 years

After having been running steadily on the previous server for almost ten(!) years, it became time to retire that machine. So, ManyTools has now been moved to a shiny new hosting cluster. You may/should notice some speed improvements. In case you notice any problems or irregularities I'd be happy if you notify me so I can check on them.

Exit Coinhive (in-browser bitcoin mining)

Thank you for your feedback on our (brief) test with browser based bitcoin mining. This seemed like a nice way to support this website, but turned out to be far too much of a burden to our visitors. So we've decided to remove it. Our apologies for the inconvenience it has caused.

Migrated to HTTPS

Happy to inform that Manytools is now fully Chrome-62-ready, thanks Google! A secure connection had been due for a very long time. Today we finally got around to upgrading the site to run on HTTPS. – (Starting October 2017, Chrome (version 62) will show a “NOT SECURE” warning when users enter text in a form on an HTTP page, and for all HTTP pages in Incognito mode.)
